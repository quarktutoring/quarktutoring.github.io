<h3>Founded to help students</h3>
<p>Quark Tutoring was founded by a group of high school students in the Bay Area. We realized that not all students have access to the academic resources they need, at school or elsewhere. We seek to help these students by offering free tutoring that is tailored to each individual's needs and circumstances.<br>
Our tutoring service matches people with academically strong high school students who are knowledgeable in the subject matter. We aim to help every student achieve success, and we promise that Quark Tutoring will always be free.</p>
